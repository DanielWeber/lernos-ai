AI is the most comprehensive term and today represents the entire field of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can mimic or surpass human intelligence. It is about systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human thought, such as visual perception, speech recognition and decision making.

In chat-based AI systems, such as ChatGPT, the prompt stands for the input text that a user sends to the language model in order to receive a response. The language model (Large Language Model or LLM) generates a response by predicting the most likely continuation of the text based on learned patterns and information. The quality of the response depends to a large extent on the prompt itself. It is therefore worth learning how to create prompts in such a way that they generate the user's desired output as well as possible.</p>"},{"location":"1-07-prompts-erstellen/#prompt-engineering","title":"Prompt engineering","text":"<p>The process of optimizing the prompt is referred to as \"prompt engineering\". There are also numerous sources and handouts on the Internet that provide tips for creating prompts under this term (see e.g. collection of links on prompt engineering in the OpenAI Cookbook for an extensive collection). However, although so much has been written about prompting, it is actually anything but difficult.  Prof. Ethan Mollick writes (translated from the article Working with AI: Two paths to prompting): \"The most important message is that you learn how to use AI by using AI. [...] The more you use AI, the more you develop a sense of what it is good and not so good for\". It is therefore much more important than prompt engineering to learn how to use an AI system by using it. Prof. Mollick writes on X (formerly Twitter) that he observes that users get the \"hang of it\" after about 10 hours of using the strongest possible AI system (such as GPT-4). So the first step is often to get started and write with the AI chatbot in a similar way to a human.</p> <p>Write as if to a human: Many people use the prompt in a similar way to the search slot of a search engine or database. With search engines and databases, it was important to reduce the question to as few and as precise search terms as possible. The whole thing had to remain concise, because too much context would only have led to inappropriate hits. Interestingly, these rules no longer apply to language models such as ChatGPT. Input in colloquial language is not a problem and more detailed input usually even leads to better answers and not to the model being \"confused\". In a sense, therefore, to use AI chatbots effectively, we need to train ourselves to do the very behaviors that search slots have trained us to do for the longest time.</p> <p>Prompt improvement by example: In this section we look at specific examples to demonstrate how to make prompts more effective. A well-formulated prompt is critical to the quality of the response you receive from an AI system. Possible problems in prompt creation can include ambiguous input, unclear intentions, suggestively worded questions or the mixing of different topics. The aim of these examples is to gain a better understanding of precise and well thought-out prompts.</p> <p>Example 1: Unclear intention:</p> <ul> <li>Bad prompt: \"Talking about plants.\"</li> <li>Why it's bad: The prompt is unclear and doesn't give a specific instruction or question.</li> <li>Better prompt: \"Can you tell me about the importance of plants to the ecosystem?\"</li> </ul> <p>Example 2: Suggestive prompts:</p> <ul> <li>Bad prompt: \"Are cell phone rays really harmful to your health?\"</li> <li>Why it's bad: This prompt could lead to misinformation as it implies an unproven claim.</li> <li>Better prompt: \"What does current research say about the effects of cell phone radiation on health?\"</li> </ul> <p>Example 3: Mixed aspects:</p> <ul> <li>Bad prompt: \"How do I bake a cake and what is the history of baking?\"</li> <li>Why it's bad: This prompt combines two different topics, which can lead to a confusing or disjointed answer.</li> <li>Better prompt: \"Can you give me a simple recipe for a chocolate cake?\"</li> </ul>"},{"location":"1-07-prompts-erstellen/#elements-of-a-good-prompt","title":"Elements of a good prompt","text":"<p>This section is about the essential components of an effective prompt. We identify key elements, such as the language model persona, introduction, customized content, format and additional information, that are helpful in creating a clear and targeted prompt and illustrate how these elements are applied in practice with an example. Finally, you will gain an insight into advanced prompting techniques that you can use to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of communication with AI models.</p> <p>The following structure has proven effective for writing good prompts:</p> <ul> <li>Persona: What role should the language model play?</li> <li>Introduction: What do I expect from the language model? Usually starts with an action word.</li> <li>Individual content: The actual text to be processed.</li> <li>Format: If necessary, what format do I expect from the output?</li> <li>Additional Information: Other relevant information that makes the context more specific.</li> </ul> <p>Here is a complete example:</p> <ul> <li>Persona: You are a travel consultant and an expert in customizing trips to foreign countries.</li> <li>Introduction: I finally have time during the coming summer vacation to go on a really big trip with my partner.</li> <li>Individual content: Create an itinerary for me for a two-week trip to Japan.

Je genauer Du den Hintergrund, Dein Anliegen und die Art der erwarteten Ausgabe beschreibst, umso besser wird die Antwort sein.</li> <li>Sei modular: Zerlege komplexe Aufgaben in eine Reihe von einfacheren Aufgaben, die nacheinander ausgef\u00fchrt werden k\u00f6nnen. Nutze Struktur, wie z. B. Stichpunkte, um Aspekte klar zu unterteilen.</li> <li>Be patient: Ask the model to describe the path to the answer first instead of answering immediately. You will get better answers if the model first develops a solution (\"chain of thought\") and then carries it out.</li> <li>Be complementary: When too little information is available, language models tend to invent inaccurate answers. Therefore, provide the model with relevant and up-to-date information so that it can answer better. If you need access to sources (such as documents or books), use AI systems that can process data. </li> <li>Be accurate: Generative AIs are not the best solution for every task. For example, language models such as GPT-3.5 are good at developing a solution procedure, but not particularly good and reliable at computing. Therefore, use other tools (such as GPT-4 with code interpreter) to perform operations that the model cannot perform independently.</li> <li>Be evaluative: Create and compare different prompts systematically to better assess and optimize the effect of the prompt and the performance of the model.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"1-07-prompts-erstellen/#providing-examples","title":"Providing examples","text":"<p>Another helpful technique to achieve better results is one-shot and few-shot learning.

Chat-based AI systems, such as ChatGPT, are designed to interact in dialogue and work best when a conversation continues. While a single exchange can provide basic information, the strengths of AI are particularly evident in continued interaction. Through follow-up questions, clarifications and further discussion, the AI can develop a deeper understanding of the user's concerns and thus provide more relevant and precise answers. In addition, a dialogue enables the AI to better grasp the context and respond to it, which is often more difficult with a one-off query.

But even without a temperature setting, you can control the creativity of the model by using linguistic instructions such as \"answer creatively and add appropriate information\" for more creativity or \"answer conscientiously and follow my instructions exactly\" for more accuracy.</p>"},{"location":"2-11-kata-10/","title":"Confident Prompting Part 1 (Kata 10)","text":""},{"location":"2-11-kata-10/#confident-prompting-part-1-kata-10","title":"Confident prompting part 1 (Kata 10)","text":"<p>In Kata 7, the effective collaboration between humans and AI was discussed and it was shown that the correct use of AI systems can increase productivity.

One of these patterns is the \"flipped interaction\" pattern, in which the usual interaction dynamic is reversed: Instead of the user asking questions, they ask the language model (LLM) to ask questions in order to achieve a specific goal.</p> <p>Procedure:</p> <ol> <li>Goal setting: The user defines a goal and the model asks targeted questions in response.</li> <li>Duration and structure: The user defines how long the question phase should last and how many questions are asked per round.</li> <li>Specificity and context: The more specific the instructions and context, the more effectively the model can gather information.</li> </ol> <p>Beispiel: KI-Wissenscheck</p> <p>Use the following prompt:</p> <p>I would like to assess and expand my knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Please ask me basic questions about AI topics to assess my current understanding. Focus on elementary concepts such as \"generative AI\", \"Large Language Models\" (LLMs) or \"hallucinations\" and avoid too difficult content. Start with simple questions and gradually increase the level of difficulty based on my answers. The aim is to find out what level my knowledge is at and which areas I should deepen.</p> <p>Tip: You can use the \"Flipped Interaction\" pattern to let the AI improve your prompt. Ask the AI to ask you questions about your original prompt and give you suggestions for improvements. This helps you to recognize ambiguities in your prompt and to formulate it more precisely. Finally, you ask the AI to formulate the improved prompt for you. This not only makes your prompt more precise, but also increases the efficiency and accuracy of the AI.</p>"},{"location":"2-12-kata-12/","title":"Review And Lessons Learned (Kata 12)","text":""},{"location":"2-12-kata-12/#review-and-lessons-learned-kata-12","title":"Review and Lessons Learned (Kata 12)","text":"<p>The time has come. After 12 weeks, the last round of the learning path is coming to an end and it's time to review these weeks. At the end, you are welcome to discuss what the biggest insights, surprises or challenges were for you in dealing with AI.</p> <p>The following questions can serve as a common thread:</p> <ul> <li>What do you take away as key experiences / highlights from the last few weeks?</li> <li>What were the most important milestones / development steps for you?</li> <li>What did you miss or fall short of in the Circle or when creating with the help of AI?</li> <li>What plans do you have for your topic / project in conjunction with your AI and what would you like to achieve next?</li> <li>What activities or requirements could there be in the future to link your human and artificial intelligence even better?</li> </ul> <p>Tip: The review was very much about how you perceived and interpreted your learning journey and your experiences. However, you can imagine that another person may have perceived and interpreted the same results very differently. Use a chat-based AI to generate other perspectives. First describe your learning journey in a matter-of-fact way, including important events. Then write how you perceived and evaluated your learning journey. Then ask the AI to invent three people with different personalities and simulate for them how they would have assessed your learning journey.</p> <p>Final tip: Celebrate success Yay, hooray, you did it - you studied together for several weeks/days, you didn't give up, you kept at it and you learned so much about AI and prompting, not just theoretically, but hopefully in practice too! And during this time you have built up a relationship of trust with each other that is at least as valuable as the work you have done together and from which you will benefit for a long time to come. So now is the time to celebrate your success. Perhaps get together for a small final event (in person or online) and enjoy your learning success! The AI can be a good source of ideas for this. The guide team wishes you much joy and success in the future and looks forward to your feedback!</p> <p>One last small request: open the page for this guide on lernos.org and leave a rating (e.g. thumbs up) and a comment with feedback at the bottom.
