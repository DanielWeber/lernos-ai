Welcome to the **learning path of the lernOS AI guide**. The central **goal** for this learning path is to create and publish at least **one AI-supported blog/LinkedIn post** (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª [example: with summary interview](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110171493103198209/)) or to pursue **your own learning project** using AI and produce results. The aim of this learning project can be extended as desired (several posts, multilingual, podcast, video, etc.).
