## Reflection on learning outcomes (Kata 4)

**Reflection check-in:**

- Think about what you have been able to take away from the first 4 weeks / katas so far. Why don't you ask the AI which reflection method they would suggest and apply it?
- Then briefly present the current status of your draft blog post or your AI learning project.
- Feel free to use different criteria for reflection, e.g. application experience, open questions and experience beyond the application.
- What are three specific lessons learnt so far from your perspective?

**Tip 1:** Did you know that you can also give your AI a persona or frame it accordingly (e.g. answer in the style of Ernest Hemingway, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Agatha Christie, Joane K. Rowling)?

**Tip 2:** Chat-based AIs are good at applying frameworks or models (e.g. from business, research or psychology) to specific scenarios. For example, ask ChatGPT something like: "Create a SWOT analysis for the sale of particularly lightweight premium smartphones in Switzerland".
