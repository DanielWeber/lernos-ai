## AI tools and services

In this section, we give you an overview of how you can get to know AI-supported work with various tools and services. We have divided them into different areas, which, like the tools and services, are still in flux.

We asked ourselves the following questions when making our selection: 

- Is the tool/service usable for beginners?
- Can it be used free of charge?
- Are the user interface and explanatory help also available in German?
- Can we assume that the requirements of the GDPR are taken into account?
- Which 3 to 5 are currently our best recommendations?

(Registration is often required as a minimum.)

### Tips & recommendations

There is so much going on here that we could add to or expand this section every day. Free offers may use older AI applications that are less powerful or have less up-to-date information. Those who use paid tools often have a wider range of functions.

With some tools and services, it makes sense to make entries in English despite the German-language interface. The AIs have often been trained with English-language data.

Well-known Office applications such as Microsoft 365 are gradually offering corporate customers corresponding extensions or integrations. Keep an eye on these providers in any case:
