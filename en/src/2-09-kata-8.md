## Reflection on learning outcomes (Kata 8)

**Reflection check-in:**

  - Think about what you have learnt from the last few weeks and present these results to each other. What were the particular challenges or highlights? Where were you able to experience quick wins or even moments of happiness and where did barriers and moments of frustration come to light?
  - Reflect critically in your group on the current status of your blog post or your AI learning project and use the examples to show each other the limits of your AI tool use (e.g. AI impulses to increase the level of creativity vs. AI spinning together incorrect information and thereby creating distortions or even manipulating content).

### Deep Dive: Visualising results
Let the AI summarise your documented results as a visualised contribution, which you can also publish later if necessary (in text, image or audio-visual form).

**Tip:** The AI can support you as a feedback partner in your reflection. Share your results so far and get feedback on what you can improve.
