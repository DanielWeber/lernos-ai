In this kata, you **select an AI tool/chatbot** with which you can take your **first steps into the world of generative AI** and explore it.

To deepen your knowledge of artificial intelligence, it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the different types of AI. The chapter [AI models](1-6-ai-models.md) gives you an overview of this. Another helpful introductory resource is the chapter [AI tools and services](1-7-ai-tools-services.md), which gives you an insight into the various tools and services available in the field of generative artificial intelligence. This is particularly important for the following tasks and will be taken up again and deepened later in [Kata 5].

### Task: Select an AI chatbot or try out several chatbots
There are various options open to you when entering the world of AI chatbots. Firstly, you should check which AI platforms are allowed to be used in your company. If there is no recommended AI tool in your company, [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com), the free version of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is often a good starting point. The AI [Pi](https://pi.ai/talk) is also worth considering, as it is easy to use without prior registration.

Choose a tool that can be used in your company and get access.

**Tip:** If you try out the same input in several chatbots, you will get a better feel for similarities and differences and learn which AI technology is better suited to which tasks.

### Task: Start with your first experiment
Now that you've familiarised yourself with choosing and accessing an AI chatbot, it's time for your first experiment. Start by typing the sentence "I'm packing my ..." into the chatbot and watch how it responds. You will probably notice that the chatbot responds with something like "suitcase". This is because the chatbot responds in such a way that the AI determines the most likely subsequent words or word groups for the part of the sentence you entered. This experiment helps you to develop a deeper understanding of how AI chatbots process language and respond to user input.

### Consolidation: Can AIs joke?
One possible exercise to deepen your understanding of AI is to ask an AI joking questions. This method was presented on the ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª [eBildungslabor.de blog](https://ebildungslabor.de/blog/ki-einstieg-mit-chatgpt-scherzfragen/) and allows the reactions and limitations of AI systems to be explored in a humorous way. The task is to formulate joke questions and observe whether and how the AI recognises them and responds humorously. This approach not only provides entertainment, but also insights
