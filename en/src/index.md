# Welcome

Welcome to the **lernOS Artificial Intelligence (AI) Guide**. The guide is available for testing in a first version 0.1. In the [lernOS KI MOOC](https://loscon.lernos.org/) from **6.5.-21.6.2024** we will put the guide to the practical test and create a version 1.0 with your feedback. You can already register for the AI MOOC [via meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/cogneon/events/297769514/). We will share our experiences at the [lernOS Convention 2024](https://loscon.lernos.org/de/).

**Aim of the guide:** To introduce people with no prior knowledge of AI to the topic of artificial intelligence so that they can make an informed decision about how/where they are affected and what benefits they could gain from AI. The technologies/examples should work in and outside of organizations (internet and intranet).

**Target group:** Users (people sitting in front of the "screen") not developers; however, users should understand the background. The guide is written for use inside (context: intranet) and outside (context: internet) organizations.

# About lernOS

lernOS is a method of self-organization for people living and working in the 21st century. To be successful today, you have to constantly learn, organize and develop yourself. No one else is responsible for this process. You have to take care of it yourself (self-directed, lifelong learning).
